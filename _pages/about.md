I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [PSL Research University](https://psl.eu/en), [Mines Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/), in the "perception and machine learning" team of the [Center for Robotics](https://www.caor.minesparis.psl.eu/presentation/perception-and-machine-learning/) (CAOR) where I'm adivsed by [Pr. Fabien Moutarde](https://people.minesparis.psl.eu/fabien.moutarde/).


My research centers on the dynamic intersection of computer vision, audio processing, and neural rendering, with a specific emphasis on multimodal learning that integrates sight and sound information. My objective is to enhance computer vision techniques by enabling them to discern both geometrical and semantic insights from the auditory modality. I also aspire to develop methods that can express spatial understanding through the generation of realistic sounds.
